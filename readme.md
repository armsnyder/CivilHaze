# Come Again
Come Again is a game that follows a group of prisoners as they perform a series of reckless prison breaks. Initially 
without any regard for one another, their own abilities or past lives, they must find a way to work together and 
escape. Along the way, sacrifices will need to be made. What will happen to those who are left behind? What will happen 
to those who find freedom?

### Starting the Game
You are welcome to play the rough prototype of the game, though be warned that the direction of the piece has drifted 
since the prototype was completed. Additionally, the cumbersome process of starting it up will be eliminated once it's 
finished.
